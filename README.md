# Digit-Classification-with-Manually-Implemented-ANN
This project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch using Python to classify handwritten digits. The neural network is trained on preprocessed image data and includes a single hidden layer. The objective is to demonstrate how an ANN works internallyâ€”without relying on libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
