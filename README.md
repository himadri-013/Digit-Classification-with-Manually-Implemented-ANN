# Handwritten Digit Classification using a Manually Implemented ANN

This project implements a simple **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch** using Python to classify **handwritten digits**. The neural network is trained on preprocessed image data and includes a **single hidden layer**. The objective is to demonstrate how an ANN works internally—without relying on libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 🧠 Features

- Fully manual implementation (no high-level ML frameworks)
- One hidden layer with size = 128
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation with gradient descent
- Evaluation on test data
- Preprocessing of handwritten image data and classification of them
